We have also added a + to the R-Ladies name. As symbols and words matter a lot, we wanted to explicitly communicate, with the use of these symbols, the importance of diversity and inclusion to our community. We used them in this useR! to reinforce that we welcome diversity and put an effort into creating collectively a safe and friendly space.</description></item><item><title>Curating for @WeAreRLadies on Twitter</title><link>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2021-09-23-curating-for-wearerladies-on-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2021-09-23-curating-for-wearerladies-on-twitter/</guid><description>Figure 1: Photo by Arno Smit on Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/photos/iI72r3gSwWY) This post was originally published on Shannon Pileggi’s personal blog.
TL; DR In February 2021 I tweeted to a daunting &amp;gt;20k followers by curating for @WeAreLadies on Twitter. This was great opportunity to share knowledge, interact with others, and learn something in return, ultimately cultivating new connections and collaborations. From preparation to fruition, I hope this post helps you confidently enroll as a curator!</description></item><item><title>The R-Ladies Mentoring Program: R-Ladies Cotonou journey</title><link>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2021-02-04-cotonout_mentoring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2021-02-04-cotonout_mentoring/</guid><description>We are very happy to provide you this blog article in different languages, English, French and Spanish.

However, we want our members to be able to stay connected and still share their latest R-related discoveries and journeys. To support our chapter organisers in moving their events online, we decided to provide them with video conferencing infrastructure.
Our network has grown to over 160 chapters worldwide so we were wondering how many meeting rooms we would need.</description></item><item><title>Recipe for a year-end video</title><link>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2020-01-27-rladies_video_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2020-01-27-rladies_video_2019/</guid><description>To close the awesome R-Ladies 2019 year we made a video, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, here it is:

Although this date has different ways of celebration, it has one point in common - the fight for gender equality. The previous year, in 2018, an enthusiast R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; group took the initiative for a massive project to tweet about all the profiles registered in the R-ladies directory, throughout 8th March 2018. In February this year, the year 2019, Yanina proposed to follow their lead and tweet about all the R-Ladies Chapters, throughout 8th March 2019.</description></item><item><title>What happened in 2018?</title><link>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2018-12-12-what-happened-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2018-12-12-what-happened-in-2018/</guid><description>Retrospective 2018 Include IWD 2018 R-Ladies growth LatinR Conferences Blog posts</description></item><item><title>vacation &lt;- grow(RLadiesNetwork)</title><link>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2018-10-27-vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://--rladies-dev.netlify.app/blog/2018-10-27-vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/</guid><description>We would like to tell you how one vacation lead to growth of R Ladies community in South America. The story involves multiple countries and crossing paths at the right time in life.
Mine Dogucu I am from Turkey but I lived in the United States most of my adulthood. In December 2014, I decided to take a trip to South America - to Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. Being a graduate student at the time put me in a need to lower my travel costs.</description></item><item><title>3.

She wanted to do something to give back to the R learning community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012. In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters launched independently around the world : Twin Cities, USA and Taipei. R-Ladies London launched in March 2016.</description></item></channel></rss>
