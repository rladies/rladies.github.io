Since inception, the R-Ladies Global organization has been run on 100% volunteer effort from individuals and chapters throughout the world. The organization is built upon layers of support - the global leadership team, the broader global team, local chapter organizers, and community members - all who donate their time and effort to sustain the mission of promoting gender diversity in the R community.</description></item><item><title>R-Ladies+ Feat. useR! 2021</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-09-24-r-ladies-feat-user-2021/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-09-24-r-ladies-feat-user-2021/</guid><description>In this post, you will see that we have used the R-Ladies logo with the colors of the rainbow and the trans flags. We have also added a + to the R-Ladies name. As symbols and words matter a lot, we wanted to explicitly communicate, with the use of these symbols, the importance of diversity and inclusion to our community. We used them in this useR! to reinforce that we welcome diversity and put an effort into creating collectively a safe and friendly space.</description></item><item><title>Curating for @WeAreRLadies on Twitter</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-09-23-curating-for-wearerladies-on-twitter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-09-23-curating-for-wearerladies-on-twitter/</guid><description>Figure 1: Photo by Arno Smit on Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/photos/iI72r3gSwWY) This post was originally published on Shannon Pileggi’s personal blog.
TL; DR In February 2021 I tweeted to a daunting &amp;gt;20k followers by curating for @WeAreLadies on Twitter. This was great opportunity to share knowledge, interact with others, and learn something in return, ultimately cultivating new connections and collaborations. From preparation to fruition, I hope this post helps you confidently enroll as a curator!</description></item><item><title>The R-Ladies Mentoring Program: R-Ladies Cotonou journey</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-02-04-cotonout_mentoring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2021-02-04-cotonout_mentoring/</guid><description>We are very happy to provide you this blog article in different languages, English, French and Spanish.

How it all started …? 🤔 R-Ladies Cotonou is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global located in Cotonou, Benin (West Africa).</description></item><item><title>Reduced Service Mode for R-Ladies Global</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/news/2020-11-23-reduced-service-note/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/news/2020-11-23-reduced-service-note/</guid><description>This year has been and continues to be a challenging year for many, if not all, of us.
We have needed to make some adjustments in our personal lives and as R-Ladies is a volunteer run organisation we also needed to make some changes in the work we do at R-Ladies Global.
Since the coronavirus pandemic began, we have added new infrastructure for online meetups via Calendly, Zoom and a YouTube channel, along with guides and training for organizers.</description></item><item><title>#BlackLivesMatter: A joint statement by Forwards and R-Ladies</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/news/2020-06-06-blm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/news/2020-06-06-blm/</guid><description>As organizations committed to broadening diversity and inclusion in our community, we stand with #BlackLivesMatter and join those who demand justice for systemic oppression. Pervasive racism negatively impacts the participation of Black people in society. The current events in the USA echo what has happened and continues to happen to minoritised people across the world. We are aggregating resources and are taking deliberate actions to amplify the voices of Black, Indigenous and People of Color in the R community now and moving forward.</description></item><item><title>R-Ladies Infrastructure for Online Meetups</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2020-04-24-online-meetups/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2020-04-24-online-meetups/</guid><description>Our chapters have cancelled in-person meetups due to the corona virus pandemic. However, we want our members to be able to stay connected and still share their latest R-related discoveries and journeys. To support our chapter organisers in moving their events online, we decided to provide them with video conferencing infrastructure.
Our network has grown to over 160 chapters worldwide so we were wondering how many meeting rooms we would need.</description></item><item><title>Recipe for a year-end video</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2020-01-27-rladies_video_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2020-01-27-rladies_video_2019/</guid><description>To close the awesome R-Ladies 2019 year we made a video, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, here it is:

Following this example, three further groups started out over the next three years. Shortly after the useR! conference in 2016, where Gabriela and other organisers met in person, the R-Ladies Global organisation was co-founded by several active community members.
Since then, the number of R-Ladies chapters has grown massively and rapidly.</description></item><item><title>R-Ladies Global's response to the DataCamp Assessment Report</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/news/2019-10-22-datacamp-third-party-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/news/2019-10-22-datacamp-third-party-review/</guid><description>DataCamp&amp;rsquo;s CEO Jonathan Cornelissen sexually assaulted an employee by making &amp;ldquo;uninvited physical contact&amp;rdquo; in October 2017. This became public in April 2019, after which we released a statement on our blog. For a comprehensive account of events, please see this article by Davey Alba for BuzzFeed News published in May 2019. DataCamp commissioned a third-party review which has now been released. This blogpost is to add some clarification around references to R-Ladies made in that report.</description></item><item><title>R-Ladies Global's disapproval of DataCamp</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/news/2019-04-08-statement-about-datacamp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/news/2019-04-08-statement-about-datacamp/</guid><description>This blog post is a slightly extended version of the official statement the R-Ladies Global organization made via Twitter, in a form that is easier to share. The views expressed here are the views of the R-Ladies Global Team signing at the end of this post and do not represent the R-Ladies community at large.
Why we condemn DataCamp&amp;rsquo;s handling of sexual assault We are very disappointed by the way DataCamp handled the sexual assault of an employee by a C-level executive.</description></item><item><title>IWD 2019 Twitter Action</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2019-03-25-blog_iwdtwitter_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2019-03-25-blog_iwdtwitter_2019/</guid><description>Every year on March 8th, the world celebrates International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day (IWD). Although this date has different ways of celebration, it has one point in common - the fight for gender equality. The previous year, in 2018, an enthusiast R-Ladies&amp;rsquo; group took the initiative for a massive project to tweet about all the profiles registered in the R-ladies directory, throughout 8th March 2018. In February this year, the year 2019, Yanina proposed to follow their lead and tweet about all the R-Ladies Chapters, throughout 8th March 2019.</description></item><item><title>What happened in 2018?</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2018-12-12-what-happened-in-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2018-12-12-what-happened-in-2018/</guid><description>Retrospective 2018 Include IWD 2018 R-Ladies growth LatinR Conferences Blog posts</description></item><item><title>vacation &lt;- grow(RLadiesNetwork)</title><link>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2018-10-27-vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.github.io/blog/2018-10-27-vacation_grow_rladiesnetwork/</guid><description>We would like to tell you how one vacation lead to growth of R Ladies community in South America. The story involves multiple countries and crossing paths at the right time in life.
Mine Dogucu I am from Turkey but I lived in the United States most of my adulthood. In December 2014, I decided to take a trip to South America - to Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. Being a graduate student at the time put me in a need to lower my travel costs.</description></item><item><title>3.

The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012. In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters launched independently around the world : Twin Cities, USA and Taipei. R-Ladies London launched in March 2016.</description></item></channel></rss>
