&lt;p>On March the 8th, International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day, we ran a continuous feed of awesome R-Ladies profiles from &lt;a href="http://rladies.org/directory/">our directory&lt;/a> via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rladies_iwd2018">@rladies_iwd2018&lt;/a>. It was a blast! And a lot of team work too! To round out our three-part blog series of the IWD Directory campaign, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss topics related to privacy law, contact information collection and the future of our R-Ladies directory project.

She wanted to do something to give back to the R learning community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012. &lt;!-- I think it would be great here to talk a bit about what an R-ladies meetup initially involved eg mentoring, training, guest speakers? -->&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
