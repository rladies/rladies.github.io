Since inception, the R-Ladies Global organization has been run on 100% volunteer effort from individuals and chapters throughout the world.
The organization is built upon layers of support - &lt;a href="https://rladies.org/about-us/team/">the global leadership team, the broader global team&lt;/a>, local chapter organizers, and community members - all who donate their time and effort to sustain the mission of promoting gender diversity in the R community.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
