She wanted to do something to give back to the R learning community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012. &lt;!-- I think it would be great here to talk a bit about what an R-ladies meetup initially involved eg mentoring, training, guest speakers? -->&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
