Since inception, the R-Ladies Global organization has been run on 100% volunteer effort from individuals and chapters throughout the world.
The organization is built upon layers of support - &lt;a href="https://rladies.org/about-us/team/">the global leadership team, the broader global team&lt;/a>, local chapter organizers, and community members - all who donate their time and effort to sustain the mission of promoting gender diversity in the R community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Request for Proposal - Javascript Development (Contract Work)</title><link>https://rladies.org/news/2022-03-28-request-for-proposal-javascript-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.org/news/2022-03-28-request-for-proposal-javascript-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The R-Ladies global organization wants to implement some new functionalities (using Javascript) for a re-implementation of their website, whose source code may be found on &lt;a href="https://github.com/rladies/website">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>R-Ladies would like to invite you to prepare a proposal to accomplish the above task that includes timeline, cost, and deliverables. The following RFP includes a background of our organization and describes the purpose of the redesign, its desired functionality, and specific requests relating to the proposal. We understand that details may be subject to change upon vendor recommendation and/ or research of more optimal solutions. In your proposal, please feel free to suggest alternatives where noted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reduced Service Mode for R-Ladies Global</title><link>https://rladies.org/news/2020-11-23-reduced-service-note/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.org/news/2020-11-23-reduced-service-note/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year has been and continues to be a challenging year for many, if not all, of us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have needed to make some adjustments in our personal lives and as R-Ladies is a volunteer run organisation we also needed to make some changes in the work we do at R-Ladies Global.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>#BlackLivesMatter: A joint statement by Forwards and R-Ladies</title><link>https://rladies.org/news/2020-06-06-blm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.org/news/2020-06-06-blm/</guid><description>&lt;p>As organizations committed to broadening diversity and inclusion in our community, we stand with #BlackLivesMatter and join those who demand justice for systemic oppression. Pervasive racism negatively impacts the participation of Black people in society. The current events in the USA echo what has happened and continues to happen to minoritised people across the world. We are aggregating resources and are taking deliberate actions to amplify the voices of Black, Indigenous and People of Color in the R community now and moving forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gabriela de Queiroz steps down from the R-Ladies Global Leadership Team</title><link>https://rladies.org/news/2019-12-18-gdq-departure/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.org/news/2019-12-18-gdq-departure/</guid><description>&lt;p>R-Ladies started out as a meetup group in San Francisco, when Gabriela de Queiroz founded the first chapter and organised the first event in 2012. Following this example, three further groups started out over the next three years. Shortly after the useR! conference in 2016, where Gabriela and other organisers met in person, the R-Ladies Global organisation was co-founded by several active community members.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>R-Ladies Global's response to the DataCamp Assessment Report</title><link>https://rladies.org/news/2019-10-22-datacamp-third-party-review/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rladies.org/news/2019-10-22-datacamp-third-party-review/</guid><description>&lt;p>DataCamp&amp;rsquo;s CEO Jonathan Cornelissen sexually assaulted an employee by making &lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community">&amp;ldquo;uninvited physical contact&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> in October 2017. This became public in April 2019, after which we released a statement on our &lt;a href="https://blog.rladies.org/post/statement-about-datacamp/">blog&lt;/a>.
