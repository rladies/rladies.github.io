R-Ladies was founded by [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/).
She wanted to do something to give back to the R learning community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free.
The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012.

<!-- I think it would be great here to talk a bit about what an R-ladies meetup initially involved eg mentoring, training, guest speakers?  -->

In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters launched independently around the world <!--who by?-->: Twin Cities, USA and Taipei.
R-Ladies London launched in March 2016.

R-Ladies Global was born at useR 2016 and the grant was susequently awarded in September 2016.
Since then, R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters<!-- there should be a link here to a list of every chapter -->and over 13000 members.
We have chapters across every continent, and many of the world's major cities.
We recently launched [R-Ladies remote](https://twitter.com/RLadiesRemote) for R-Ladies who don't currently live somewhere large enough for a chapter, or our restricted from attending meetups due to family concerns.

<!-- I'd love to say something here about R-ladies impact now. ie our events serve all R users from absolute beginners to experienced users. Some of the most respected R-users in both industry and academia are involved in R-ladies eg ... Some examples of some events that we have had or more obscure places R ladies are being formed, etc?-->
