Thinking about submitting a talk for **Posit Conf 2025** but feeling nervous about recording a video abstract? You are not alone! It can feel intimidating at first, but the good news is it is just **one minute** and all about showcasing your idea effectively.

## **Tips from Past Speakers**

We know that recording a video can feel like a challenge, so we collated some advice from past speakers:

ðŸ“½  **Rachael Dempsey**: Go ahead and set a date and time on your calendar and block it off to record your video. ðŸ—“ I had blocked off a Friday afternoon at 2pm. Give yourself a bit more time than you think you need. You might record yourself about 4+ times. [[Read more excellent advise from Rachael in this detailed LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachaeldempsey_a-little-birdie-told-me-that-the-call-for-activity-7282863651554754563-Zy_I/).]

ðŸŽ¤ **Shannon Pileggi**: Ask more than one person for feedback on your abstract and video content - everyone has a different and valuable point of view.Think about the way the principles of your content apply broadly to a general audience. [[Read Shannon's blog post talking about her experience of getting accepted to speak at Posit Conf here](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2024-10-24-iterating-to-achieve-my-first-accepted-positconf-talk/).]

ðŸ’¡ **Nic Crane**: Check out the [Posit blog post which tells you what they're looking for](https://posit.co/blog/how-we-build-the-positconf-program/) and has examples of past submissions.  Before recording, I try to get myself pumped up with energy by doing a dummy run pretending my idea is the most interesting thing I've heard in my entire life, with exaggerated enthusiasm, so then the normal version I do immediately afterwards has a bit of bounce to it.

## **What Tech Should You Use?**

#### Simplest Options (Free & Easy):
 - `Phone/Laptop Camera`: This is perfectly acceptable! Just ensure good lighting (face the light source) and a stable surface for your device. Most phones and laptops have built-in video recording capabilities.
 - `QuickTime (Mac)`: If you have a Mac, QuickTime Player has a built-in screen recording feature. You can record your screen and your webcam simultaneously.
 - `Zoom (App/Web)`: Zoom's built-in recording feature makes it easy to capture your screen and webcam simultaneously. Share your slides, practice your one-minute pitch, and download the MP4 file for submission

#### Slightly Advanced (Free/Open Source):
 - `OBS Studio (Windows, Mac, Linux)`: OBS Studio is free and open-source, offering more control over your recording, including screen capture, webcam input, and basic audio mixing. While powerful, it might have a small learning curve.
 - `VLC Media Player (Windows, Mac, Linux)`: VLC can also be used for basic recording. It's a versatile player that can capture video from your webcam. 

#### User Friendly (Paid):
 - `Canva`: offers a user-friendly platform with recording capabilities. You can easily create slides with your key points and record yourself presenting them. Canva also provides editing features to polish your video.

## **How to Structure Your Video**

Here's a simple way to approach your **one-minute** video:

#### 1. Start with the Basics

Introduce yourself and your idea. Pull from the abstract of your talk and expand slightly to explain what your talk is about.

#### 2. Share Why It Matters

Why is your idea important to you? Why does it excite you? People love to see genuine enthusiasm - it is contagious! Highlight why your topic could be interesting or helpful to the audience.

#### 3. Keep It Conversational

Talk as if you are **explaining to a friend,** not reading from a script. Keep it engaging and natural.

#### 4. Speak Clearly & With Energy

Passion is contagious! **Slow down a bit,** use your voice expressively, and **have fun with it.**

#### 5. Don't Worry About Perfection

Your video doesn't need to be flawless - just **authentic**. If selected, you will get speaker training!

#### 6. Humor and Creativity are Welcome

If your idea lends itself to something quirky or funny, don't shy away. Even if your topic seems niche, an engaging presentation can make it appealing to everyone.  But don't worry if you are not naturally funny either - this is only optional.

## **Tips for Success**

* **Pep Talk Yourself:** Before recording, remind yourself that you are great at what you do. Boosting your confidence will help you project positivity and ease.  
* **Keep It Simple:** Your video doesn't need to be polished or perfect. Focus on your enthusiasm and message.  
* **Check Out Examples:** Watch [other video abstracts](https://posit.co/blog/how-we-build-the-positconf-program/) for inspiration.

## **Need Feedback?**

If you would like input on your abstract or video, we are happy to help! Share a link to your draft (Google Drive or similar), and we will assign a reviewer.

- **Abstract** : Paste your abstract in a Google Doc/other sharable medium for review.

- **Video Draft** : Share a link to your draft recording. The recording could be uploaded to Google Drive, YouTube (unlisted), Vimeo, or any other sharable platform.

By "video draft" we mean an initial recording that reviewers will offer one round of feedback on.  If you want feedback on specific aspects of your video (e.g., pacing, clarity, or technical quality), please mention it in the form. Otherwise, we will assume youâ€™re looking for general feedback.

Although we encourage submitting at least 3 weeks from the final deadline, there is still a chance we will be able to pair you up with a reviewer with a shorter timeline, so just do it.
