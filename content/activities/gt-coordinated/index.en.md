title: "Coordinated by the Global Team"
---

The majority of work for R-Ladies is done by the excellent chapter organisers around the world. 
For this, R-Ladies as a global organisation helps with technical infrastructure and a network the organisers can rely on for help and guidance if they need it.

In addition, the Global team coordinates more ..


## Community Slack
The Community Slack is intended for people that identify as a woman or gender minority and are interested in the R programming language.
It is a friendly and welcoming community, where you can share information, learn new things and connect with other R-Ladies.
The Community Slack is intended to be a harassment-free experience for everyone and the [Code of Conduct](coc/) is enforced to make sure everyone can enjoy the space.

## Abstract Review
R-Ladies Global has a system for review and feedback of conference abstracts and funding opportunities for both R-related and domain-specific conferences. 
To encourage R-Ladies to submit proposals and improve chances of having work or applications selected, 80 international reviewers provide constructive feedback on areas including topics and pitch, phrasing, and subject matter.

## Rotating Twitter Curator (rocur)
The **[R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies Global.      
  
**Objectives**  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.   
  
**How It Works**  
  
Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in R. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.  

Check out [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) every Monday for a new curator!
