title: "Coordinated by the Global Team"
---

The majority of work for R-Ladies is done by the excellent chapter organisers around the world.
For this, R-Ladies as a global organisation helps with technical infrastructure and a network the organisers can rely on for help and guidance if they need it.

In addition, the Global team coordinates activities that span all chapters.
These activities ensure the chapter and R-Ladies around the world can access the international network and aid that exists for the community.
In addition, many of the activities facilitate visibility of R-Ladies actions and minority genders in tech and R in particular.

## Community Slack

The Community Slack is intended for people that identify as a woman or gender minority and are interested in the R programming language.
It is a friendly and welcoming community, where you can share information, learn new things and connect with other R-Ladies.
The Community Slack is intended to be a harassment-free experience for everyone and the [Code of Conduct](/coc/) is enforced to make sure everyone can enjoy the space.

## Abstract Review

R-Ladies Global has a system for review and feedback of conference abstracts and funding opportunities for both R-related and domain-specific conferences.
To encourage R-Ladies to submit proposals and improve chances of having work or applications selected, 80 international reviewers provide constructive feedback on areas including topics and pitch, phrasing, and subject matter.

## Rotating Twitter Curator (rocur)

The \*\* [R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)\*\*is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week.
This account is run by R-Ladies Global.

**Objectives**

1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies community.
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.

**How It Works**

Every week, a different R-Lady takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in R.
Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences in R, from novice to expert.

Check out [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) every Monday for a new curator!
