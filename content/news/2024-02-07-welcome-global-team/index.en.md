# Onboarding needs

Between 2020-2023, membership R-Ladies global organization increased 
while the availability of volunteers remained limited. At the conclusion of this
time period several global team members retired. We are indebted for their 
efforts that helped the organization thrive and grateful for their time spent 
on the global team. 

As the shift in personnel occurred, new teams and team structures were identified
to distribute the workload as well as to provide coverage of roles for times when
volunteers are unavailable. The new members of the global team are vital to
help support and grow our community.

# Onboarding process


With these amazing new members, we have also been able to develop
a new onboarding system for the global team. By using GitHub actions
and issues, we hope that the onboarding process will be more streamlined
in the future. While the current new members did experience this system in its infancy,
we hope that it will be a smoother process for future members.

# What the future holds

We are excited to see what the future holds for R-Ladies with these new
members of the Global Team. Having new people, with fresh ideas and 
perspectives, will help us to continue to grow and improve as an organization.
We are looking forward to working with these new members, and we hope
that you will join us in welcoming them to the Global Team!
