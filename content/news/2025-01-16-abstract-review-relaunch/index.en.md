We know how challenging it can be to take that first step into public speaking and submit an abstract for a conference. 

That's why we're thrilled to announce the **relaunch of the R-Ladies Abstract Review System**! ðŸŽ‰

Our system connects aspiring speakers with reviewers who provide feedback and guidance, helping them refine their abstracts and scholarship applications.

## What Does the Abstract Review System Do?

Volunteers with experience in public speaking, abstract writing, and conference submissions will review your work and offer constructive guidance.

Whether it's your first conference abstract or a scholarship application, we're here to help you shine.

## Who Can Benefit?

This service is open to anyone in the R-Ladies community preparing to submit:

* Conference abstracts: For conferences like posit::conf, EARL, UseR!, JSM, and more.
* Scholarship applications: For opportunities supporting attendance at conferences and events.

## How It Works

Submit a Request: Fill out our form at <https://airtable.com/appJadVolZxoDGSIK/pagkXaAIuPged83dn/form> with details about your abstract or application and the type of feedback you'd like.

Reviewer Assignment: We'll match you with a reviewer based on your needs and preferences.

Receive Feedback: You'll get helpful feedback to refine your submission.

It's that easy!

**Pro Tip: Submit your request at least three weeks before the conference deadline to allow enough time for review and revisions.**
