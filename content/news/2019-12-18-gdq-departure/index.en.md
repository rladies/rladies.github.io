R-Ladies started out as a meetup group in San Francisco, when Gabriela de Queiroz founded the first chapter and organised the first event in 2012. Following this example, three further groups started out over the next three years. Shortly after the useR! conference in 2016, where Gabriela and other organisers met in person, the R-Ladies Global organisation was co-founded by several active community members. 

Since then, the number of R-Ladies chapters has grown massively and rapidly. R-Ladies as an organisation and as a community wouldn't be where it is today without Gabrielaâ€™s contributions. With a heavy heart, Gabriela is now leaving the Global Leadership Team. We profoundly thank her for getting us all started on this endeavour and all the time, effort, and belief that Gabriela poured into R-Ladies. All the best for the future, Gabriela!
