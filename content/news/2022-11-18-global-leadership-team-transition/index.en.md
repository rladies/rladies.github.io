R-Ladies first began as a meet-up in 2012, and became a global organization in 2016.
Since inception, the R-Ladies Global organization has been run on 100% volunteer effort from individuals and chapters throughout the world.
The organization is built upon layers of support - [the global leadership team, the broader global team](/about-us/team/), local chapter organizers, and community members - all who donate their time and effort to sustain the mission of promoting gender diversity in the R community.

Having served on the leadership team since the inception of the global organization in 2016, Erin LeDell (United States), Claudia Vitolo (Italy), and Hannah Frick (England) are now stepping down.
Over the past six years, R-Ladies experienced tremendous growth in community members and reach around the world.
In more recent years, R-Ladies survived and thrived throughout the pandemic by pivoting to online meet-ups, enabling knowledge sharing and community engagement both within and across chapters. 
We are forever grateful to Erin, Claudia, and Hannah for their thoughtful guidance supported by the many volunteers at all levels of the organization.

We are tremendously excited to announce a passing of the torch to the new Global Leadership Team: Athanasia Monika Mowinckel (Norway), Yanina Bellini Saibene (Argentina), Shannon Pileggi (United States), Riva Quiroga (Chile), and Averi Giudicessi (United States). 
We are indebted to both Yanina and Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal (India), as well as the departing leadership team, for their work to ensure a smooth transition.
We are committed to the R-Ladies Global mission of encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of minority genders in the R community, and we are honored to serve the global organization in this capacity.
We are also committed to stay true to the promises made by the departing leadership team, and carry on their legacy to the best of our ability.

Erin LeDell, Claudia Vitolo, Hannah Frick, Athanasia Monika Mowinckel, Yanina Bellini Saibene, Shannon Pileggi, Riva Quiroga, and Averi Giudicessi
