# Why we are migrating to Mastodon

Today, we want to share an important update concerning our communication strategy. Over the years, Twitter (now X) has served as a vital platform where we have fostered connections, celebrated R-Ladies' achievements, and shared our passion for R as a programming language. It has played an integral role in our journey. Nevertheless, given the shifting values of that platform, we no longer consider it a healthy environment to engage with our community. Consequently, our presence on Twitter has gradually diminished, leading us to cease tweeting in May.

As R-Ladies' commitment to building an inclusive and friendly community remains unwavering, we believe it is time to embrace the change that serves this commitment and enhances our community's experience. Following many of our community members, we are excited to share that we have joined Mastodon on the [Hachyderm server](https://hachyderm.io/about), a platform that we believe aligns more closely with our values. Mastodon provides us with an opportunity to create a space focused on meaningful interactions, inclusivity, and community building. We hope to make Mastodon an integral part of our communication strategy moving forward. If you are interested in learning more about how to interact on Mastodon, see this [guide to Mastodon](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon).

# Some considerations

In order to maintain  control of our handle and archive, the X  `@RLadiesGlobal` account will remain open; however, we will no longer engage in that platform.

We believe each local chapter knows their community and is best qualified to determine which social media channels are most appropriate. Therefore, we are not requiring local chapters to follow this change, but strongly encourage them to consider expanding their engagement to Mastodon.

We are working on other ways to engage with our community, and will share all the ways to stay in touch, share, and continue to grow together as they become available. Please let us know if you think we should include a particular channel in our social media strategy.

See you on Mastodon and elsewhere!
