We're absolutely thrilled to announce that the [R-Ladies Rotating Curation (RoCur) account](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org) is now live on Bluesky! Each week, a new member of the R-Ladies community will take over the account to talk about all things R. This will be a fantastic opportunity for individuals who identify as a minority gender in the R community to amplify their voices and connect with others in the greater data science community.

## History

Some of you might recall the RoCur account on Twitter. The program ran for about five years, giving over 100 curators the chance to take over the account and share their stories. While the Twitter account is no longer active, the archive of posts can still be viewed [here](https://rladies.org/tweet-archive/wearerladies/).

## How You Can Help

We're excited to revive the RoCur program on Bluesky, picking up where we left off. You can help us build back the community stronger than ever by signing up to be a curator or nominating someone to be a curator!

## Become a Curator

*Are you interested in becoming a curator?* Curating is a great way to build your social media presence, develop your science communication skills, expand your CV, and connect with a supportive community. Sign up to be a curator on [this form](https://airtable.com/appjkZZgtF0iEWFjx/pagqsAma1WmUYxa9j/form). We're currently looking for curators until the middle of 2025, and we'll open up more spots as the year progresses.

## Nominate Someone

*Do you know someone who'd be a perfect curator?* Perhaps a colleague, someone from your local R-Ladies chapter, or a user you can't get enough of on Bluesky! You can help us identify fantastic curators by nominating them. Submit your nominations on [this form](https://airtable.com/appFIBzsk2AxWlGMt/pagfezjuCxohikOOa/form). You can nominate as many people as you'd like, so don't hesitate to share this opportunity.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the RoCur admins at [weare\@rladies.org](mailto:weare@rladies.org) or shoot a message on the **#rocur** channel on the [R-Ladies Community Slack](https://rladies.org/form/community-slack/).
