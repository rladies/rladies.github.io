<p>R-Ladies was founded by <a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a>. She wanted to do something to give back to the R learning community after going to several meetups and learning a lot for free. The first meetup took place in San Francisco, California (United States) on October 1, 2012. <!-- I think it would be great here to talk a bit about what an R-ladies meetup initially involved eg mentoring, training, guest speakers?  --></p>
<p>In the following years two more R-Ladies chapters launched independently around the world <!--who by?-->: Twin Cities, USA and Taipei. R-Ladies London launched in March 2016. <!--I don't really understand this bit - did Gabriella initiate the other R ladies groups or did they all start organically? was it a coincidence that they were all called R-Ladies? Who set up these groups?--> Although each chapter started working independently,<!-- ~~the need for high-level coordination and support became evident at useR! 2016 where the San Francisco and London chapters met.~~ -->all this changed at useR! 2016, when the organisers of the global R-ladies chapters met in person for the first time.</p>
<p>The R-ladies meeting at useR! realised the importance of a global R-ladies to support local chapters and help new R-ladies chapters form anywhere in the world. <a href="https://rladies.org/united-states-rladies/name/gabriela-de-queiroz/">Gabriela de Queiroz</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/erin-ledell/">Erin LeDell</a> from R-Ladies San Francisco and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/chiin-rui-tan/">Chiin-Rui Tan</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/alice-daish/">Alice Daish</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/hannah-frick/">Hannah Frick</a>, <a href="https://rladies.org/ladies-complete-list/name/rachel-kirkham/">Rachel Kirkham</a> and <a href="https://rladies.org/r-speakers/name/claudia-vitolo/">Claudia Vitolo</a> from R-Ladies London as well as Heather Turner teamed up to apply for an R-Consortium <a href="https://github.com/rladies/global/blob/master/rconsortium/FINAL%20-%20201607-%20rconsortiumproposalr-ladiesalignmentandglobalexpansion-july2016.pdf">grant to support and encourage the global expansion of the R-Ladies organisation</a>.</p>
<p>R-Ladies Global was born at useR 2016 and the grant was susequently awarded in September 2016. Since then, R-Ladies has grown to 63 chapters <!-- there should be a link here to a list of every chapter --> and over 13000 members. We have chapters across every continent, and many of the world’s major cities. We recently launched <a href="https://twitter.com/RLadiesRemote">R-Ladies remote</a> for R-Ladies who don’t currently live somewhere large enough for a chapter, or our restricted from attending meetups due to family concerns.</p>
<!-- I'd love to say something here about R-ladies impact now. ie our events serve all R users from absolute beginners to experienced users. Some of the most respected R-users in both industry and academia are involved in R-ladies eg ... Some examples of some events that we have had or more obscure places R ladies are being formed, etc?-->
<p>Thanks to our amazing organisers and R-Ladies who helped build and maintain our official website (<a href="https://rladies.org/">rladies.org</a>), engage with the larger community via social media - (<a href="https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal?lang=en">@RLadiesGlobal</a>) and help each-other every day in millions of different ways.
