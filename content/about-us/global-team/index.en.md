R-ladies Global is run by a volunteer group with designated responsibilities within the organisation.
The leadership team has an overarching role, making sure the organisation is well-structured, keeps promises made to sponsors and members, and directs the evolution of R-ladies as a whole.

If you would like to join the Global team, you can read more about what being part of the R-Ladies is about in our [R-Ladies Guide](https://guide.rladies.org/about/globalteam/).
Please have a look at our [current vacancies](https://airtable.com/appZjaV7eM0Y9FsHZ/shrDBOsyaFS28wOxZ), and fill out [our interest form](/form/global-team-application/), if you feel any of the roles are of interest to you.
